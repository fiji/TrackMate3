 * Interface for classes that access model graph properties.
 * <p>
 * To make {@link TrackSchemeGraph} adaptable to various model graph type
 * without requiring the graph to implement specific interfaces, we access
 * properties of model vertices and edges (for example the label of a vertex)
 * through {@link ModelGraphProperties}.
 * <p>
 * This class only offers read access to properties. They must be set elsewhere.
 * Edge and vertex properties are accessed through the edge and vertex ID (see
 * {@link GraphIdBimap}).
