/**
 * Interface for feature projections.
 * <p>
 * Feature projections are read-only projections of a {@link Feature} on a real
 * axis. A feature projection is a real, scalar function, mapped on
 * <code>double</code>s. They help plotting and representing multi-dimensional
 * features.
 * <p>
 * For instance, the velocity vector is a feature calculated for an edge.
 * Adequate feature projections for this feature would be:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the speed (velocity vector magnitude).
 * <li>the signed velocity along X axis.
 * <li>the signed velocity along Y axis.
 * <li>the signed velocity along Z axis.
 * <li><code>theta</code> the velocity vector angle measured in the OXY plane
 * with respect to X axis (0ยบ to 360ยบ).
 * <li><code>phi</code> the velocity vector angle measured in the OMZ plane with
 * respect to Z axis (0ยบ to 180ยบ).
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @param <K>
 *            the feature target (vertex, edge, ...).
